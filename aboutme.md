Hi, I'm Liam. I like to [build stuff](https://github.com/lozog) and [write songs](https://tom-swift.bandcamp.com/). I also like [taking photos on film](https://www.instagram.com/l__ozog/) and I listen to [a lot](https://www.last.fm/user/Tom_Swift) of music.


Stuff I'm interested in:  
- software development  
- songwriting & music production  
- photography  
- graphic design & visual art
