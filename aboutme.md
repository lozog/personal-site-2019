My name is Liam Ozog. I'm in my fourth year of studying computer science at the University of Waterloo.

Stuff I'm interested in:  
- software development  
- songwriting & music production  
- photography  
- graphic design & visual art

I listen to [a lot](https://www.last.fm/user/Tom_Swift) of music. Sometimes I [make some](https://soundcloud.com/lozog), too. I also like [taking pictures](https://www.instagram.com/l__ozog/).
